Grid 8/3
Rule B 2 S 3 4 5


Big oscillator (most often, except trivial)
|1(A2(B|1(a2(B|1)))(b(A3(B|1))))(A3(B|1(a2(B|1))))(A(b(A3(B|1))))(a2(B|1))(a(B|1))

hollow circle
(a(B(A3(B|1))(a2(B|1))(A4(B(a(B|1))))))(A3(B|1))(A(b(A3(B|1)))(B(a(B|1))))(a3(B|1))(A2(B(a2(B|1))))(B|1)

4-flipflop
(A2(B|1))(b|1)(A4(B|1))(a(B|1))(a2(B(A3(B|1))))
